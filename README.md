# Purpose
NLP models for reference, learning and research

This intention of this repository is to serve as a reference for modeling related to NLP. I'll be updating it more often and adding code for **reference**, **learning** and **research**. To start things off I've added a very simple LSTM based Language Model using the example from [PyTorch Example Github](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/word_language_model) as a reference. 

More to follow soon.
